## Main Story Line

In 2043, Hong Kong was taken over by a group of highly intelligent and mischievous wild boars. As a new student at HKU, you find yourself trapped on campus with these boars running amok. The boars have planted mines all over the campus, and it's up to you to sweep them clean.

The Wild Boar King isn't giving up that easily after you successfully swept all the mines - let me remind you. Instead, he's issued a new challenge, and it's time to put your skills to the test once again. The Wild Boar King's challenge is a game of Snake - the classic arcade game where you control a growing snake and try to eat as many apples as possible without running into the walls or your tail. 

It turned out that after you've proven your skills to the Wild Boar King, he's come to ask for your help. The boars have had a powerful crystal stolen from them, and they need it back to carry out their plans. The crystal is hidden in a chamber deep within the campus, but a maze of boxes blocks the entrance. The Wild Boar King knows you're the only one who can push the boxes and clear a path to the chamber. 

Complete the challenges to uncover clues about the boars' plans and the secret to defeating them. But fear not - you have what it takes to save the day!
